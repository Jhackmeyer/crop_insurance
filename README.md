# Crop Insurance

## Project Proposal and Purpose

The United States produces enough crops to feed 10 billion.  Impressive, particularly considering 86% of U.S. agricultural products are grown and rasied on family farms and ranches.  Agricultural products also numbers amongst the few resources the U.S. exports more than imports.  It makes sense, it seems, that the government is eager to subsidize the industry.

However, a bad yield, a harsh year of scarce rain, or a steep decline in price can spell ruin for a farm.  This is where crop insurance comes in.  Farmers will insure swaths of their land for a percentage of either yield (how much they think they'll produce) or revenue (how much they think they'll make.)  If a wheat farm makes half what it should one year, and it is insured for 75% yield, the farmer will be compensated up to his/her 75% mark.

It can be overwhelming for a farmer to sift through all the options and math involved each year to pick an ideal plan.  So, usually, a claimant will go with whatever plan they took last year.

My hope is to develop a streamlined system for processing, optimizing, and visualizing the coverage options across each plot of land (called 'grids') to make decisions easier for farmers and processes faster for insurance workers.
